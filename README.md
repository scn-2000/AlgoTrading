# AlgoTrading

Hello Jonathan & Yohan,
I juste made this repo as requested (it is my first repo) - I you have something is not clear or have any question, you have my details, feel free to reach out.
Again, I would like to emphasize that this is a basic code, so do not expect too much.

What I basically do is:
-Think about a strategy and take a look at it (e.g. by reading, looking at TradingView, ...)
-Download the tickers (mostly S&P500 tickers but can also use other tickers that are available on YahooFinance)
-Upload the tickers in my code
-Clean the data
-Implement my strategies in the code
-Output my strategy in an Excel file where I can backtest
-For all this, I mostly use: Excel, Python, YahooFinance, YahooFinance api (called yfinance), Pandas, and a techinal analysis library

In this repo you should find the (basic!) algorithmic trading I have been working on during my free time.

In this repo you find an Excel document with the S&P500 tickers (this are the tickers the strategy will run on - you can add/delete/replace with tickers of your choice if you want).

I worked on many (over 20) strategies - I have uploaded 3 of them.

For every strategy there is a .txt file that explains the strategy and a .py (or.ipynb) file that has the code in it.

I have also uploaded one example of the output (Excel file: "output_strategy_1_example") the algorithm creates. I just added, back then, some colors and layout to this document.

Thank you for taking a look into this, 
Samuel
